Regarding the disclaimer "WARNING: Open Graph is modern spyware. You should use this if and only if you don't mind making the readers of your wiki/blog being tracked by evil corporations without their consent. By using this plugin you are being mean to the people who are reading your content. You have been warned."

I have looked up how open graph is described to work, and don't see how this can be considered spyware. All it seems to do is enable to control how shared links are displayed on social networks that implement the protocol, and possibly on those platforms determine how many times a link to my site would be shared a little more easily, but there doesn't seem to be a way readers of my site would be tracked thanks to the metadata on the wiki. Even if they are users of social networks and logged in there, their browsing of my site won't be tracked after open graph metadata is included. Is that incorrect?
