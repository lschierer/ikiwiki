[tla](http://wiki.gnuarch.org/) is an implementation of the
[GNU](http://www.gnu.org/) [Arch](http://www.gnuarch.org/) revision control
system. Ikiwiki supports storing a wiki in tla.

Warning: Since tla is not being maintained, neither is this plugin, and
using ikiwiki with tla is not recommended.

Ikiwiki can run as a [[post-commit]] hook to update a wiki whenever commits
come in. When running as a [[cgi]] with tla, ikiwiki automatically
commits edited pages to the Arch repostory, and uses the Arch
log to generate the [[RecentChanges]] page.

Note that the tla support needs the [[!cpan MailTools]] perl module.
