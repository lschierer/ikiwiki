[Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org/) is a distributed revison control
system developed by Canonical Ltd. Ikiwiki supports storing a wiki in a
bzr repository.

Ikiwiki can run as a post-update hook to update a wiki whenever commits
come in. When running as a [[cgi]] with bzr, ikiwiki automatically
commits edited pages, and uses the bzr history to generate the
[[RecentChanges]] page.
