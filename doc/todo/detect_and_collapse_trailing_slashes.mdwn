Specifying a setup `url` with a trailing slash (e.g. `url: https://example.org/`)
results in feeds generated with double-slashes in them e.g. RSS:

    <link>http://localhost//blog/donkey/</link>

Atom

    <id>http://localhost//blog/donkey/</id>

The solution is not to specify `url` with a trailing slash. But if you have
done, and later remove it, the newly-generated RSS/Atom feeds will have
different IDs causing duplicate posts in feed aggregators.

The request is to do one of

 * detect trailing slash on `url` and remove it
 * squash '//' to '/' in link-generation
