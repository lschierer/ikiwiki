It's common now for web pages to support light and dark mode, so
switching the OS into dark mode makes the background black and into light
mode makes the background white. This feels to me like something lacking in
ikiwiki's minimalistic default css.

It's actually really easy to implement this with css. Just don't set any
colors explicitly, and tell the browser to use the default color for the
selected color scheme. The attached diff gets most of the way there though
there will be things that need improvement.

I think it probably does not make sense to apply these changes to style.css
directly though, because it will likely break sites that start with
style.css and then override parts of it in local.css. For example, if
someone made their text a little bit lighter but still close to black,
but relied on the  default white background, applying this would make their
text almost unreadable in black mode.

So, I think adding a theme that consists only of the patched css
is probably the best way to implement this.
