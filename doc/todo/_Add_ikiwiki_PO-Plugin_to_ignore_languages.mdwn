[[!template  id=gitbranch branch=feature/15355-po-plugin-disable-languages author="[[intrigeri]]"]]

`po_disabled_languages` is used to disable languages on the website. It
can be used to prepare new translations, while it will hide those from
the end-user. More precisely, PO files for these languages are updated
normally, however, HTML creation will be disabled and no reference to
these translations will be visible on the website.

> As with everything else in the `po` plugin: I would really want to see
> some regression test coverage before merging this, because as far as I'm
> aware none of the ikiwiki maintainers use the `po` plugin, so we are
> not able to detect regressions other than via the automated tests. That
> isn't a good situation to be in for a plugin that uses `IkiWiki::inject`
> to monkey-patch ikiwiki internals. If this plugin is important to you,
> more test coverage would be very much appreciated.

>> I've put this branch into a shape that I now dare submitting:
>> https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/ikiwiki/-/tree/feature/15355-po-plugin-disable-languages.
>> It adds a little bit test coverage in the form of integration tests
>> for the proposed feature, that incidentally exercise the rest of the
>> basic functionality of the PO plugin.
>> Credits go to hefee for the initial work; I merely did a lot of polishing.
>> Happy to squash all this into a single commit if you prefer.

>>> Please let me know if the added test coverage is sufficient to unblock
