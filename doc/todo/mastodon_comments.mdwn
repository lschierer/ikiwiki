I'm getting truly fed up with spam in my wiki. At this point, all comments are manually approved and I still get trouble: now it's scammers spamming the registration form with dummy accounts, which bounce back to me when I make new posts, or just generate backscatter for the confirmation email. It's really bad. I have hundreds of users registered on my blog, and I don't know which are spammy, which aren't.

So. I'm considering ditching ikiwiki comments altogether and I'm turning towards Mastodon as a commenting platforms. Others (JAK) have implemented this [as a server](https://github.com/julian-klode/mastodon-comments) but a more interesting approach for me is to simply load them dynamically from the server, which is what [this person has done](https://carlschwan.eu/2020/12/29/adding-comments-to-your-static-blog-with-mastodon/). They are using Hugo, however, so they can easily embed page metadata in the template to load the right server with the right comment ID.

I'm not sure how to do this in ikiwiki: how can we access page-specific data in [[templates]]?

Or maybe i just need to make a new template and insert it in my blog posts... pondering. --[[anarcat]]
