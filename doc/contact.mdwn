The ikiwiki project strongly encourages collaboration through ikiwiki itself,
and thus does not have a mailing list.  Anyone can create an account on
ikiwiki's own wiki. ikiwiki provides a [[bug_tracker|bugs]], a
[[TODO_list|TODO]], and "discussion" sub-pages for every page, as well as a
[[forum]] for general questions and discussion. ikiwiki
developers monitor [[RecentChanges]] closely, via the webpage, email,
and IRC, and respond in a timely fashion.

You could also drop by the IRC channel `#ikiwiki` on
[OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/) (`irc.oftc.net`).

However, if you find a new security vulnerability, please email the maintainers
privately instead of raising it in a public medium, so that we can
arrange for coordinated disclosure when a fix is available. The maintainers
are [[Joey Hess|joey]] (<joey@kitenet.net>),
[[Simon McVittie|smcv]] (<smcv@debian.org>)
and [[Amitai Schleier|schmonz]] (<schmonz-web-ikiwiki@schmonz.com>).
