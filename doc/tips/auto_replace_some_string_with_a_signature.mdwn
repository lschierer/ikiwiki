Some other wikis offer a feature where a particular string in your
text is substituted for a _signature_, e.g., `~~~~` is expanded to
something of your choosing.

If you are using [[git]], you can achieve something similar, at
least for edits in a local clone of your repository, by leveraging
Git filters.

To set this up for a local clone:

1. add this line to `.git/info/attributes`

        *.mdwn filter=signature

   You could choose to add this to `.gitattributes` instead, and
   commit that to the repository as well. You could also adjust
   the path match to your settings/tastes. Here, we are only
   applying this for edits to [[plugins/mdwn]] files.

2. Configure a "clean" filter for your local clone which performs
   the substitution, e.g.

        git config filter.signature.clean 'sed "s#~~~~#*â€” \[[Jon]], $(date +%Y-%m-%d)*#"'

   "signature" here can be anything so long as it matches the name
   in the attributes file, above.
