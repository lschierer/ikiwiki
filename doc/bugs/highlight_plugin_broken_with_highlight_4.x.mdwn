[Reported to Debian](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1050377):

> The latest upload of highlight effectively breaks any ikiwiki install
> using the highlight plugin, since the plugin crashes trying to run the
> searchDataDir() method.
> 
> The attached patch switches to calling initSearchDirectories, per
> upstream's migration guide. It seems to work on my site.
