the w3 validator fails on the main ikiwiki website because of the way inline scripts are handled. For example, [validating](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fikiwiki.info%2Fforum%2Fconvention_for_signing_posts_to_ikiwiki.info%2F) the post [[forum/convention_for_signing_posts_to_ikiwiki.info]] leads to this warning:

[[!format txt """
Warning: The charset attribute on the script element is obsolete.

From line 271, column 1; to line 271, column 78

>↩↩</div>↩<script src="../../ikiwiki/ikiwiki.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></scri
"""]]

Seems like a low-hanging fruit... 

There are other errors on my blog, namely the `pubdate=pubdate` blob added by `IkiWiki::displaytime`, no idea where that's coming from, but it's not standard anymore. See for example, [this validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fanarc.at%2Fblog%2F2020-04-27-drowning-camera%2F) and also the [time element specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element). It looks like it was [part of HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/the-time-element.html#attr-time-pubdate) but was removed at some later point. According to [this GitHub comment on the react project](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3411#issuecomment-80234574), it was replaced by the [itemprop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/itemprop) attribute, as in `itemprop="datePublished"`. See also [this w3 example](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element:the-article-element-11). Phew.

> For pubdate, I created [[pubdate not valid for html5]] in 2020, with a patch. I've applied that in my *opinionated ikiwiki* [[container|containers]].  -- [[Jon]], 2022-09-06
