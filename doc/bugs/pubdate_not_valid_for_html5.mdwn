The `pubdate` attribute is not valid for modern HTML(5).

The [h-entry microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry) describes
an alternative way to achieve the same thing: a `dt-published` class name.

> LGTM. In [[bugs/charset_attribute_on_the_script_element_is_obsolete]], I found that `itemprop="datePublished"` was another way to do this, but it seems like there is no real standard way to do this anymore, so I'm happy with anything that doesn't break validators. :) *--[[anarcat]], 2022-09-06*
