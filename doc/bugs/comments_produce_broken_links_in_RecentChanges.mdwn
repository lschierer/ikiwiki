Comments produce links like `sandbox/comment_1` in [[RecentChanges]], which,
when clicked, redirect to a page that does not exist.

The `recentchanges` branch in my repository contains one possible [[patch]],
which causes the CGI to go to the [[ikiwiki/directive/meta]] `permalink`, if
any, if the page is internal (comments do have a permalink).
