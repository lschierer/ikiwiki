Related to using --cgi on command-line. The man page should just be more
clear. ikiwiki-1.35 has: "Enable  CGI  mode. ..." To me this implies that
is configuring something that will enable CGI mode. If I understand it
correctly, it should say "Run ikiwiki as a CGI. Normally this is used from
the ikiwiki.cgi CGI wrapper. ..."

> The man page says:

  Enable [[CGI]] mode. In cgi mode ikiwiki __runs as a cgi script__, and
  supports editing pages, signing in, registration, and displaying
  [[RecentChanges]].

  __To use ikiwiki as a [[CGI]] program you need to use --wrapper or --setup
  to generate a wrapper.__ The wrapper will generally need to run suid 6755
  to the user who owns the `source` and `destination` directories.
