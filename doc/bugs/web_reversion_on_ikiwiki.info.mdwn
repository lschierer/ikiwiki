I created [[sandbox/revert me]] and then tried the revert button on
[[recentchanges]], but I was not allowed to revert it. The specific error
was

    Error: you are not allowed to change sandbox/revert_me.mdwn

I've just tried reading through the revert code, and I haven't figured out
what permission I am lacking.  Perhaps the error message could be a little
clearer on that. The error might have been thrown by git_parse_changes in
git.pm or check_canchange in IkiWiki.pm, via IkiWiki::Receive. -- Jon
