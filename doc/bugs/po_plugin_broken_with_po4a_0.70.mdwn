po4a version 0.70 and newer appear to have changed the API enough that the IkiWiki
po plugin is broken.

This was reported as a FTBFS bug in Debian: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1072760>

I think this patch is sufficient: <https://salsa.debian.org/jmtd/ikiwiki/-/commit/65f13f08901806a3b458cd625369e27bf19722e0>
