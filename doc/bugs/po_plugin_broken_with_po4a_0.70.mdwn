po4a version 0.70 and newer appear to have changed the API enough that the IkiWiki
po plugin is broken.

This was reported as a FTBFS bug in Debian: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1072760>

I think this patch is sufficient: <https://salsa.debian.org/jmtd/ikiwiki/-/commit/65f13f08901806a3b458cd625369e27bf19722e0>

> I've pushed a Debian package update with a slightly more involved patch:
> <https://salsa.debian.org/debian/ikiwiki/-/blob/debian/master/debian/patches/0001-Adjustments-for-po4a-0.7.0.patch?ref_type=heads>
> I'm unavailable for a couple of weeks so I'll let it "soak" in Debian before committing it here.
