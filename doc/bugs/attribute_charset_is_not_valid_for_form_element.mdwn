[[!template id=gitbranch branch=jon/form-attribute-accept-charset author="[[Jon]]"]][[!tag patch]]

Originally reported to Debian in 2009 at <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=523701>

IkiWiki generates `form` elements with `charset` attributes in a few places. The Debian bug pointed at the "add comment" form, but there are other instances.

`charset` is not a valid attribute for the form element in HTML(5). We probably want `accept-charset`, instead:
<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#attr-form-accept-charset>

The WHATWG spec page above suggests the only valid value for the attribute is UTF-8. Is it superfluous? Or does the presence of the attribute change browser behaviour?
