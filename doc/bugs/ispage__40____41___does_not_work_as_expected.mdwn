In a few places, it is recommended to try the `ispage()` pagespec, described at [[ikiwiki/pagespec/attachment]] but provided by the (supposedly independent) plugin [[plugins/filecheck]].

I've had trouble getting it to work so put together a minimal test-case. Very basic wiki with filecheck enabled (but attachment not).

File structure as follows

```
index.mdwn
a/foo.mdwn
a/bar.txt
a/pic.png
```

index containing

```
\[[!map pages="a/*"]]
\[[!map pages="a/* and ispage()"]]
```

The first map expands, as expected, to

 *  bar.txt
 *  foo
 *  pic.png

The second is empty. Expected behaviour:

 * foo

(with [[plugins/txt]] not enabled)

> * `match_ispage` gets called with argument "a/foo"
> * it calls `Ikiwiki::pagetype` with that argument unmodified

> * base is calculated to be "foo"
> * the next branch fails as $hooks{htmlize}{foo} is false
