# Plugins

I wrote and maintain a few plugins, which are available here: [[https://framagit.org/spalax/gresille-ikiwiki]].

[[!map pages="plugins/contrib/* and ! plugins/contrib/*/* and author(spalax)"]]

# Wishlist

I have a few things in mind. Their status is something between *I will implement it someday* to *maybe someone could need this* or *I will need it if I implement this killer website I have in mind*.

* [[plugins/contrib/usermanager]]: Create a cgi page to manage users (add/remove users, give/remove administrative priviledge to users, change password, etc.
* [[plugins/contrib/htaccess]]: Have an [[htacess|//httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html]] file to be automatically updated each time an user is added/deleted, or its password is changed).
