> Interesting that there's an unofficial Matrix room! There's actually a semi-official *IRC* channel which means it is also somewhat accessible over Matrix, in <https://matrix.to/#/#oftc_ikiwki:matrix.org>. This should really be documented better, but it's mentioned in [[news/irc_channel]]. :) -- [[anarcat]]
