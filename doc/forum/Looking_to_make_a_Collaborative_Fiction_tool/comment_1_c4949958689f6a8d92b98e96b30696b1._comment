Hello,

\"I want them to be able to choose who can see their work, I want them to be able to choose who can edit their work\" -  how do you see this controlled?

\"I want people to be able to use their characters and settings to write stories\" - what do you mean - other than have one pages 'My list of characters' and anorher page 'My story' - what else does the software need to be able to do?

\"in both realtime and asynchronously\" -- could you please tell more details about this feature? Do you mean 'live' collaborative editing when there are several users editing a page at the same time?

Thanks.
