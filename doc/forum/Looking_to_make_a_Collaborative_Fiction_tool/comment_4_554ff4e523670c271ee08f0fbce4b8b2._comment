It definitely does grys.

And yes, the permissions are important because people have said they want to be able to write stuff, but keep it hidden from their players until its time for them to see it. Players also tend to like to do this for character notes as well, keeping things hidden and there just for themselves. The ownership is necessary because of culture, players don't see their character as part of the story but the story as part of their experiences.
