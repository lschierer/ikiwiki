Including more characters into `wiki_file_chars` did fix something, but I'm still deciding if all are fixed.

That's why I wanted the reporting on `*.mdwn~` files which is the majority of the \"skipping bad filename XXX\" lines out of the way.

I don't want `*.mdwn~` files to be built into the files deployed to the web site, but I do want to keep them in the source files so they are available as backups, i.e. their designed purpose for Emacs.

I've found this setting that seem to be able to exclude file types:
```
exclude => '^(.*\\.bak|.*\\.[:alnum:]+~|#.*#)$',
```

Although it seems it requires single square brackets in `[:alnum:]` while the `wiki_file_chars` requires double square brackets. Isn't that odd?
