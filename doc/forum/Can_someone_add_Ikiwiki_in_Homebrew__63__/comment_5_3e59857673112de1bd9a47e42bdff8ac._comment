Since no one else had done it, I've created a basic Homebrew Tap (ie non-core Formula) for ikiwiki, now that Homebrew has support for external (ie, non-core) Formulas developed by end users:

[https://github.com/naosnz/homebrew-ikiwiki](https://github.com/naosnz/homebrew-ikiwiki)

Only tested on macOS 13 (Ventura) so far, and only with very basic ikiwiki features from the command line which is pretty much all I need for my purpose.  (Lots of the more advanced ikiwiki features/plugins will need more Perl modules installed, which anyone who needs them will need to figure out; there are some examples of having Homebrew install ikiwiki Perl \"resources\" in the formula for essential Perl modules which might be a guide how to add more.)
