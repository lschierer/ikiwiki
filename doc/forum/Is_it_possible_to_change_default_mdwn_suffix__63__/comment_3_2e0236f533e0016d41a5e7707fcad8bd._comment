> why was I able to remove joey's comment

IkiWiki is (largely) a Wiki, and the base behaviour of a Wiki is everyone can edit it, and anything can be reverted (including your deletion)

A related, unanswered question: [[forum/Everyone can remove comments]]. I reported this as a bug, too: [[bugs/logged in users can remove any comments]].

On a related note, I'll assume [this edit](http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blobdiff;f=doc/security/discussion.mdwn;h=f510eb21780143dc3ad1f6c0d033f05e623885b4;hp=ddf61c5f8771c581a449fd07f106f62cc3d60026;hb=8ac1f2d18a99a10e9783500710ade73d833c01e8;hpb=eecb06e7e55d3a77e8567b59892de38b7e8d507c) of yours was accidental; please don't deliberately nuke any more useful pages. We have a [[sandbox]] for experiments.
