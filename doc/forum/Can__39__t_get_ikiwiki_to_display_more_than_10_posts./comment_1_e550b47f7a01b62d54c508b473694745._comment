[[backlinks]] are links from other pages back to the current page, that are shown at the bottom of a page by default. It's not related to the blog listing.

The blog listing is generated with an [[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive.

Go to the page that contains your blog listing and edit it. You will see the inline directive with a parameter `limit=\"10\"` (or `show=\"10\"`, which is outdated but still works).
