I have been browsing the `templates` directory and the css files to understand where the placement of the feedbuttons is determined, but can't seem to figure it out fully. They appear to be generated by line 388 in `inline.pm` for a blog setup, which reads in `feedlink.tmpl`. Is there a way to configure where they are rendered on the page in `page.tmpl` or through some crafty CSS?

Thanks,
Frederik
