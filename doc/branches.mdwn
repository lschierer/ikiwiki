In order to refer to a branch in one of the [[git]] repositories, for
example when submitting a [[patch]], you can use the
[[templates/gitbranch]] template. For example:

	\[[!template id=gitbranch branch=yourrepo/amazingbranch author="\[[yourname]]"]]

Branches that have been [[reviewed]] and need work will not be listed
here.

Branches referred to in open [[bugs]] and [[todo]]:

[[!inline pages="(todo/* or bugs/*) and link(/branches) and !link(bugs/done)
and !link(todo/done) and !*/*/*" show=0 archive=yes]]

Long-lived branches in the main git repository:

* `ignore` gets various branches merged to it that [[Joey]] wishes to ignore
  when looking at everyone's unmerged changes.
* `setup` contains the ikiwiki.setup file for this site
